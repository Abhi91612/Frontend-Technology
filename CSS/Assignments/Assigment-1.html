    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <li class="text-space">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li class="text-space">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
    <li class="text-space">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li class="text-space">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <mark>in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles </mark>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>

    <p class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p class="p3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
